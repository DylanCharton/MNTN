# MNTN
My first project while attending the Access Code School training courses.
I put it on GitHub a bit later because I didn't know how to use Git and GitHub when I worked on it. However, today I *corrected* a few things and thought it was good for me to have it here.

This is not a project that is going to change a lot, I have some ideas but **nothing** tremendous. However then, it is a good indicator for me of how I improved my coding skills.
